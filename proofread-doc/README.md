# LLM-Powered Documentation Proofreading

This example shows how to use an Interaction to proofread documentation,
using [Composable Prompts's Studio](https://composableprompts.com/features).

It uses an Interaction "Proofread Documentation" that takes a document as input and ouput
the updated document. By default it uses GPT-4 but it can also run on Llama2 and Mistral easily.

As you can see, it takes less than 10 lines of code to have this task executed by a LLM and integrated into your client code!

You can learn more on [how to use Interactions in Typescript / Javascript](https://docs.composableprompts.com/execute) on in the documentation.

You can clone and use this code as a base.

We plan to adapt it and make it into a generic Github Action for easy use as part of workflows.
